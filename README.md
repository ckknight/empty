# empty

This project is intentionally empty.

It has a TypeScript definition where precisely 0 types are exported.

When executed at runtime, this provides a CommonJS module with no changes to its
`module.exports`.

This can be used within the `"resolutions"` of a `package.json` to replace a
problematic package with an empty one.
